## üéß About The Project

GrooveMaster is a state-of-the-art music discovery and recommendation system that harnesses the power of deep learning and advanced AI algorithms to deliver highly personalized music suggestions. Using a sophisticated hybrid approach combining Neural Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, and K-Nearest Neighbors, this system analyzes Spotify's most streamed songs of 2024 to provide intelligent and context-aware music recommendations.

### üìã Project Overview

This advanced music discovery platform analyzes streaming trends and user preferences using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. By combining deep neural networks, collaborative filtering, and nearest neighbor analysis, we create a comprehensive understanding of music relationships and listener preferences.

The system implements:
- Deep Learning-based recommendation engine
- Neural Collaborative Filtering
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization
- K-Nearest Neighbors analysis
- Interactive command-line interface with colored output
- Comprehensive music similarity analysis

### üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle: "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024". It includes comprehensive information about songs, such as:

- Streaming metrics
- Cross-platform engagement data
- Artist and track information
- Platform-specific popularity scores
- Social media engagement metrics
- Content features and metadata
